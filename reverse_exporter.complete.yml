# an executable script can also be passed with a special `exec` URL. exec proxy's have two modes:
# in non-caching mode, the proxy runs an instance of the script as soon as a request is received,
# and buffers up additional requests - returning the result data to all of them once execution is
# finished. Only a single instance is ever executing.
# In caching mode, the command is executed continuously with a given timeout, and cached results
# are served to Prometheus instances. Your script should probably include a timestamp in this mode.
